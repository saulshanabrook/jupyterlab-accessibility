# Quinten's Killer Weed Butter


*Ingredients:*
* 1/2 to 1 ounce of high quality bud /or 3-4 ounces of shake
* 2 sticks of organic unsalted butter (or coconut oil) *oil needs to be solid at lower temps

Preheat oven to 275. Grind cannabis and spread over shallow pan lined with aluminum foil. Roast for 25 minutes. *this process decarbs the cannabis by using heat to turn the THCA molecules into THC.

In a slow cooker, add 6 cups of water and turn heat to low/medium. Add sticks of butter to slow cooker, stirring occasionally. Once butter has melted, add in cannabis. Simmer for 6-12 hours, stirring evey 45 min.

Turn off slow cooker; let mixture cool for at least 1 hour. Carefully pour entire mixture into a tall pitcher or cyclical container (try not to use containers that have smaller openings compared to their body [extreme example: 2 liter of soda]). Cover mixture and chill in fridge overnight.

Once mixture has solidified, using a butter knife, slowly work along the edges to carefully remove your infused butter/oil from the water mixture. All debris should have sunk to bottom of container. Using a clean cloth or paper towel, gently pat dry. Store in air tight container and use within three weeks, or freeze. Compost debris.

* Utilizing this method, a typical serving of butter should equate to a low-to-normal dosage of THC. However, foods requiring high amounts of butter/oil (I'm looking at you brownies) will pack more THC per serving.
