## üåé What is open source software?
* Open source software is public, collaborative, free code anyone can use. 
* Individuals work on code contributions "locally" on their own computers and can use platforms like Github to collaborate.
* Wikipedia is an example of open source, not only by sharing the information, but the code for the website is worked on in the open on Github.

## ‚òÇÔ∏è What is Jupyter?
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is a non-profit open source software for data analysis that is worked on in the open on GitHub.
* Jupyter is a community of people who work together to improve the software. It doesn't belong to any one company, and is controlled democratically by groups of interested contributors like you! Also IBM, Amazon, Apple, Quansight, universities, etc.
* It is also refered to as Project Jupyter, which is an umbrella for Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, JupyterHub (we'll define these later).

## üìö What are Jupyter Notebooks?
* Jupyter Notebooks are used by students, teachers, researchers, statisticians, scientists, and anyone who needs to use programming to analyze data.
* Jupyter Notebooks is an interactive feature that lets you mix narrative, code, and results.
* Jupyter Noteboooks allows you to code across different programming languages. Actually, the name Jupyter is a combo of 3 languages, *Ju*lia, *Pyt*hon, *R*

## ‚öó What is JupyterLab?
* JupyterLab is for writing Jupyter Notebooks. JupyterLab is a software that lets you edit Jupyter Notebooks right in your browser on a website. So, Jupyter Notebooks is like images while JupyterLab is like photoshop.
* JupyterLab is mostly written in JavaScript and some python but not everyone who works on it is a programmer. There are many ways to contribute that don't involve writing code such as design, giving feedback, project management, engaging with the community, and running events. 

## To be covered:

*  JupyterHub, JupyterBook, MyBinder, Lumino

Binder is a way to send a jupiter notebook and have someone open it in their browser and start playing with it. people use it for research papers. A way to host jupiter notebooks
more for something they can interact with and play with, but not really to save results.
