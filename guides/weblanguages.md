# 🕸 Web Languages

## ☠️ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

* Markdown gets converted into HTML
* Your web browser is built to understand and render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no other languages) into websites.
* HTML is like the "bones" providing the structure.    
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is like the "Skin" containing the elements and the look and feel 
* JavaScript is like the "Muscles" for movement and action!
    * ex. when you click a button and it moves something on the page 

## 🤙 DIY

You can try to look at the HTML and CSS on your own web broswer using the "developer tools" which shows the code behind websites. It depends on your broswer, but for google chrome at the top you got to view > developer tools.

In the screenshot below, on the left side you can see the HTML (zoom in if you can't see), and on the right is the CSS showing the styling of the text and elements.
