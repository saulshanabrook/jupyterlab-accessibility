One quick way to find out exactly how much plastic/non-biodegradable stuff u throw away: 
	1. Decide to not throw away your trash for 1 or 2 weeks
	2. Keep smelly trash in freezer 
	3. throw compostables over the fence into ur neighbor's yard
	4. Notice what has "forever trash" bits to it that you may  not have noticed (ex. shrink wrap around meat, chip bags, plastic bags around bread, TAKE OUT)
	
Just a cool quick audit. I never noticed a lot of these things but now the grocery store looks totally diff.

Kind of a fun challenge to try and keep trash from piling up during the week (or 2)
