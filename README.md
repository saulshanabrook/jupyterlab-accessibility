# 🌱 Welcome

We aim to support each other in having fun and learning code through an applied project. People who talk to computers go by many different names. From most casual to "impressive on a resume" you can say: coder, programmer, software developer, software engineer, software architect (those guys make the big bucks!). 🤑  

This is a github repository (not suppository)!💩 Repository or "repo" as they say in the biz is a collection of files and discussions. Github is like google drive + soundcloud + facebook for coders, a place to store code, post, share and discuss. Github is built on git which is a software for tracking changes. Everyone can independently work on their own copy of the code, and merge the changes together from different branches.🌳  

## 🤓 Basic Qs

### 💕 What is open source software?
* Software is a collection of instructions for the computer, unlike hardware such as a computer mouse.
* Open source software is public, collaborative, free code anyone can use.

### ✨ What is Jupyter?
* Jupyter is a community of people who work together to improve the software. It doesn't belong to any one company, and is controlled democratically by groups of interested contributors like you! Also IBM, Amazon, Apple, Quansight, universities, etc.

### 📚 What are Jupyter Notebooks?
* Jupyter Notebooks are used by students, teachers, researchers, statisticians, scientists, and anyone who needs to use programming to analyze data.
* Jupyter Notebooks is an interactive feature that lets you mix narrative, code, and results.
* Jupyter Noteboooks allows you to code across different programming languages. Actually, the name Jupyter is a combo of 3 languages, *Ju*lia, *Pyt*hon, *R*

### 👾 What is JupyterLab?
* JupyterLab is for writing Jupyter Notebooks. JupyterLab is a software that lets you edit Jupyter Notebooks right in your browser on a website. So, Jupyter Notebooks is like images while JupyterLab is like photoshop.
* JupyterLab is mostly written in JavaScript and some python but not everyone who works on it is a programmer. There are many ways to contribute that don't involve writing code such as design, giving feedback, project management, engaging with the community, and running events. 

## 🚀 JupyterLab Accessibility

### 🤔 Where do we come in?
* We will be learning code by participating in the work the [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) community is doing to make it more accessible for users with disabilities.

### 🔥 What is accessibility? 
* Accessibility is about designing for users with diverse needs. This includes visual (low vision, blindness, or color blindness), deaf/hard of hearing, physical, motor and general disabilities. Recommendations are based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG.  Check out this [website](https://www.a11yproject.com/) to learn more and watch this 16 minute [webinar](https://mawconsultingllc.com/webinars/webinar-intro-to-accessibility/). ♿️
* We also care about lowering the barrier to entry to become involved in open source, so that these important projects can better represent the diversity of our world.

## 🌎 Meetings

JupterLab hosts weekly accessibility meetings Wednesdays 1:15pm EST, alternating between JupyterLab Accessibility Quickstart (for newcomers!) and an all community meeting for everyone. Additionally, we will plan our own internal meetings to support each other. 

### 📅 Upcoming:
* Tuesday 3/2 5:30 PM EST internal meeting [notes](https://github.com/saulshanabrook/jupyterlab-accessibility/discussions/8)
    *   Homework: set up your computer for development  and/or sign up for [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (check notes for details)
* Wednesday 3/3 1:15 EST JupyterLab Accessibility Quickstart (for newcomers!)
    *   Homework: look at this summary of all the [issues](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/9399)
