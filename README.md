# 🌱 Welcome

We aim to support each other in having fun and learning to code through an applied project. We will be learning code by participating in the work the JupyterLab community is doing to make it more accessible for users with disabilities.

## 🤓 Basics

### 👀 What is coding?
* Software is a collection of instructions for the computer, unlike hardware such as a computer mouse.
* People who talk to computers go by many different names. From most casual to "impressive on a resume" you can say: coder, programmer, software developer, software engineer, software architect (those guys make the big bucks!).🤑  
* languages and binary 

### 🌳 What is Github?
* GitHub is like google drive + soundcloud + facebook for coders, a place to store code, post, share and discuss. 
* GitHub is built on Git which is a software for tracking changes. Everyone can independently work on their own copy of the code, and merge the changes together from different branches.

### 🗄 What is a GitHub Repository?
* This group is a GitHub Repository (not suppository)!💩 Repository or "repo" as they say in the biz is a collection of files and discussions. 
* You can click "watch" to get email notificiations for this group's repo, and feel free to post in the discussion! This is the main [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) repository, but you don't need to subscribe since it's a lot. 

### 💕 What is open source software?
* Open source software is public, collaborative, free code anyone can use. 
* Individuals work on code contributions "locally" on their own computers and can use platforms like Github to collaborate. Wikipedia is an example of open source, not only by sharing the information, but the code for the website is worked on in the open on Github.

## 🚀 Project Jupyter 

### ☂️ What is Jupyter?
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is a non-profit open source software for data analysis that is worked on in the open on GitHub.
* Jupyter is a community of people who work together to improve the software. It doesn't belong to any one company, and is controlled democratically by groups of interested contributors like you! Also IBM, Amazon, Apple, Quansight, universities, etc.
* It is also refered to as Project Jupyter, which is an umbrella for Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, JupyterHub (we'll define these later).

### 📚 What are Jupyter Notebooks?
* Jupyter Notebooks are used by students, teachers, researchers, statisticians, scientists, and anyone who needs to use programming to analyze data.
* Jupyter Notebooks is an interactive feature that lets you mix narrative, code, and results.
* Jupyter Noteboooks allows you to code across different programming languages. Actually, the name Jupyter is a combo of 3 languages, *Ju*lia, *Pyt*hon, *R*

### 👾 What is JupyterLab?
* JupyterLab is for writing Jupyter Notebooks. JupyterLab is a software that lets you edit Jupyter Notebooks right in your browser on a website. So, Jupyter Notebooks is like images while JupyterLab is like photoshop.
* JupyterLab is mostly written in JavaScript and some python but not everyone who works on it is a programmer. There are many ways to contribute that don't involve writing code such as design, giving feedback, project management, engaging with the community, and running events. 

## 🔥 JupyterLab Accessibility

### What is accessibility? 
* Accessibility is about designing for users with diverse needs. This includes visual (low vision, blindness, or color blindness), deaf/hard of hearing, physical, motor and general disabilities. Recommendations are based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG.  Check out this [website](https://www.a11yproject.com/) to learn more and watch this 16 minute [webinar](https://mawconsultingllc.com/webinars/webinar-intro-to-accessibility/). ♿️
* We also care about lowering the barrier to entry to become involved in open source, so that these important projects can better represent the diversity of our world.

## 🌎 Meetings

JupterLab hosts weekly accessibility meetings Wednesdays 1:15pm EST, alternating between JupyterLab Accessibility Quickstart (for newcomers!) and an all community meeting for everyone. Additionally, we will plan our own internal meetings to support each other. 

### 📅 Upcoming:
* Tuesday 3/2 5:30 PM EST internal meeting [notes](https://github.com/saulshanabrook/jupyterlab-accessibility/discussions/8)
    *   Homework: set up your computer for development  and/or sign up for [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (check notes for details)
* Wednesday 3/3 1:15 EST JupyterLab Accessibility Quickstart (for newcomers!)
    *   Homework: look at this summary of all the [issues](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/9399)
