# Overview

We have two types of weekly meetings to help us check in:

- **JupterLab** hosts weekly accessibility meetings **Wednesdays 1:15pm EST**.
  - These meetings alternate between JupyterLab Accessibility Quickstart (for **newcomers**!) and an all community **developer** meeting for everyone.
  - You can see a list of these meetings on the [Jupyter meeting calendar](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html#jupyter-community-meetings) (as well as all other Jupyter meetings. All are open, so feel free to drop into any of them). The times are in PST so add 3 for EST.
  - They are all on the [Jupyter Zoom](https://zoom.us/my/jovyan?pwd=c0JZTHlNdS9Sek9vdzR3aTJ4SzFTQT09)
- Additionally, we host our own **internal** meetings Tuesdays at 5:30pm EST.
  - We try to make Google Calander events for each of these, which link to the notes.
  - They are all on Sara's sisters, [Julia's, peronsal zoom](https://zoom.us/j/9912833569?pwd=V1p0dTg0RzlBK0FPWmVKMUdrcTdTUT09)
